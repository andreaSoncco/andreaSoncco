Hey there! I'm a Web Developer and I love working with **JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML**. I have a solid background in<br>these languages and have contributed to some amazing ones projects in **Laboratoria** 💛💻. I consider myself someone open to learning new technologies and tools, since computing is my passion and I love to see where it can take me, always exploring and looking for new and different ways to provide solutions to users 💡. Working with others is something I'm great at too! 🙋🏽.

In my previous role as an **accounting assistant**, I actually ran an ERP system. It was all 
about being efficient and accurate, and those skills totally transfer over into my programming
work 👩‍💻.

Right now, I'm really focused on JavaScript feature development and exploring the world of **backend development**. I'm always learning and keeping up with the latest by checking out official documentation and listening to cool podcasts 🧏🏻‍♀️.

My ultimate goal is to use my experience to make websites super optimized and I'm determined to do it using **agile methodologie SCRUM** 💡.

**More about me:**
 
- **Hobbies:** Art, music, movies, cicle and go to the cinema with friends 🎨🎬🎭.
- **Likes:** Spring, chocolate and color green lemon 💚.
- **Phrase:** *"Always is today"* 🍀.
